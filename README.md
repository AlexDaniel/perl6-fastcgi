# FastCGI for Perl 6 #

A library for building web applications using FastCGI in Perl 6.
Uses a PSGI-compliant interface by default, so you can use it with
any PSGI-compliant frameworks, such as WWW::App.

## NOTE

This is a work in progress, and currently is not implemented.
When I'm done implementing this, I will likely go back and refactor
my SCGI library to use a class structure closer to this.

## Author

This was build by Timothy Totten. You can find me on #perl6 with the nickname supernovus.
